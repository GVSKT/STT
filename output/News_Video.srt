19
00:03:10,50 --> 00:03:13,40
increasingly making its presence felt around the world

20
00:03:14,35 --> 00:03:15,55
when we talk of

21
00:03:16,50 --> 00:03:26,80
change and the climate change we were faced with now we're talking about and to you know climate than that resulting

22
00:03:27,0: --> 00:03:28,10
from

23
00:03:28,50 --> 00:03:30,0:

from economic process

27
00:03:40,25 --> 00:03:40,90
and this

28
00:03:41,60 --> 00:03:46,50
you know the the increasingly in house as predominantly has been

29
00:03:46,75 --> 00:03:49,60
senator western and developed

30
00:03:51,80 --> 00:03:53,10
and

31
00:03:53,90 --> 00:03:55,50
what that is resulting 

32
00:03:55,85 --> 00:03:58,45
changing rainfall pattern and change

33
00:04:00,75 --> 00:04:03,25
and that and as a result of that

34
00:04:03,60 --> 00:04:07,20
many developing countries are impacted 

35
00:04:07,80 --> 00:04:10,40
and you know

36
00:04:10,70 --> 00:04:12,85
you know frequency

37
00:04:14,40 --> 00:04:17,50
extreme weather events and 

38
00:04:18,35 --> 00:04:20,45
and also severity of

39
00:04:20,85 --> 00:04:22,65
so is it sir

40
00:04:25,25 --> 00:04:29,45
went on we mean or or what what climate change

41
00:04:30,50 --> 00:04:32,0:
now is all about

42
00:04:32,45 --> 00:04:34,15
small small islands

43
00:04:34,65 --> 00:04:35,70
in the

44
00:04:36,10 --> 00:04:43,45
the benison i inly impacted and their piteous end leader

45
00:04:44,25 --> 00:04:47,05
you know

46
00:04:47,25 --> 00:04:48,60
standing in water or

47
00:04:50,35 --> 00:04:51,85
sergeant making

48
00:04:53,40 --> 00:04:57,95
it reality of the islands and they will

49
00:04:58,55 --> 00:04:59,25
with

50
00:04:59,45 --> 00:05:00,60
you know the

51
00:05:00,80 --> 00:05:02,60
increasing what a level and

52
00:05:02,85 --> 00:05:04,85
the levers and this is

53
00:05:05,55 --> 00:05:09,60
even passion of aniseed

54
00:05:10,30 --> 00:05:17,05
ah this recurrent like you said he this major recurrent event you know donation in africa

55
00:05:17,50 --> 00:05:18,95
floods in other

56
00:05:19,15 --> 00:05:23,45
you know it can change around as well there's plagiaries

57
00:05:23,85 --> 00:05:24,75
so it

58
00:05:25,30 --> 00:05:28,55
this happening and like i said was increased temper

59
00:05:29,30 --> 00:05:34,80
you know with increased them wear and change a waterfall pattern

60
00:05:34,95 --> 00:05:36,65
ability of climate and

61
00:05:36,90 --> 00:05:38,10
intensity

62
00:05:38,45 --> 00:05:41,70

63
00:05:42,40 --> 00:05:43,90
matamore and that

64
00:05:44,55 --> 00:05:47,25
no governmental panelling that 

65
00:05:49,95 --> 00:05:51,70
and what's happening 

66
00:05:53,85 --> 00:05:58,10
as to livelihood life loss loss of the

67
